<u><b><font size ="8">Web Basics</font></b></u>
<br>
<font size="4"><p>The wolrd wide web is a colleciton of HTML documents, which is the main document type on the web. <em>In addition</em> to HTML, the following file types can be found on the web:<br></font>
<br>
  -Images<br>
  -Video<br>
  -Plain text<br>
  -Music
  <br>

  HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language." This is the basis for every web page. HTML documents contain text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references to other documents, and links to other pages.<a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48230539/m-48742046">This video</a> is a good place to start.</p>
  <u><b><font size ="8">How the Web Works</font></b></u><br><br>
  First, let's define the <em>major pieces</em> of the web:<br><br>
  -Servers - Computers that host the files that make up the web<br>
  -Internet - world's largest computer nerwork<br>
  -Browser - program that displays files on your computer from the web<br>
  -HTTP - the main protocol used by browsers to communicate with servers<br><br>
  The browser on your computer and makes requests to servers via the internet using the HTTP protocol. The servers respond with files that your browser displays. <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48329854/m-48480">Here's a good explanation. </a><br><br>
  <u><b><font size ="8">HTML Tags / Elements</font></b></u><br><br>
  HTML markup is made up "tags." Tags look something like this:
  <"Tag name"> Contents <"/Tag name"><br><br>
  The two tag names are always the same, while the first one is called the <em>opening</em> tag and the second is called the <em>closing</em> tag.
  The opening tag, its contents, and the closing tag as a whole can be referred to as an <b>element</b>. HTML tags are used to help the browser identify the type of each element.You can find an introduction of the two <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">here</a>.<br><br>

 <u><b><font size ="8">Computers Are Stupid?</font></b></u>
  <p>It's important to remember that computers interpret the instructions humans give them <em>literally</em>. One small typo or mistake that  "smart" human could correct can lead to huge problems when given to a computer. What do you think happens when you forget to insert a closing tag?

  <u><b><font size ="8">Inline vs. Block Elements</font></b></u>
  <p>You may notice that text on multiple lines will appear on a single line when written in HTML. 
  Tags such as <""br""> and <"p"> can aid in creating line breaks. The <b>break</b> tag is an inline element that signifies the end of a line. The <b>paragraph</b> tag is a block element that creates an invisible box around its contents. <a href="www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">This</a> video is a big help.
